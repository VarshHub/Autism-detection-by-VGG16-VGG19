Autism Detection Using Facial Images
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to detect signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) â€” specifically VGG16 and VGG19 architectures.

Project Overview
Early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder plays a crucial role in providing effective care and support. In this project, deep learning models are trained to analyze facial features and classify whether a person shows traits associated with autism.

The models are fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques, leveraging pretrained VGG16 and VGG19 networks for better accuracy and faster convergence.

Key Features
Implemented VGG16 and VGG19 CNN architectures for image classification.
Image preprocessing and augmentation to enhance model performance.
Achieved high accuracy in classification of ASD vs non-ASD images.
Visualized model performance using confusion matrices and accuracy plots.
