•Developed a deep learning model to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using facial
images.Implemented VGG16 and VGG19 architectures to extract meaningful features and classify autistic
vs. non-autistic images.

•Applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature learning and image classification.Worked with a
publicly available dataset of 2,936 facial images to ensure robust training and testing.

•Optimized model performance by comparing VGG16 vs. VGG19 and analyzing the effect of network depth
on accuracy.
